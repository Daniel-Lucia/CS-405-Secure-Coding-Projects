# CS-405 Secure Coding Projects Description

This repo contains code for the CS 405 Secure Coding. This course focused on identifying, preventing, and mitigating software vulnerabilities, particularly within C/C++ applications. Throughout this course, I learned to implement secure coding standards to defend against common threats like numeric overflows, buffer overflows, and injection attacks through practical, hands-on coding and testing projects.
